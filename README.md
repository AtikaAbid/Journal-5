# Flutter Multi-Feature App

A Flutter application with two main features:
1. A **Dice Rolling App** that changes the dice image on button click.
2. A **Tabbed Information App** that displays personal details using multiple tabs and `TextSpan`.

## Features
### **1. Dice Rolling App**
- A button click updates the dice image randomly.
- Uses Flutter's `setState` to update UI dynamically.

### **2. Tabbed Information App**
- Three tabs:
  - **Introduction** (Uses `TextSpan` to format text)
  - **Educational Information** (Uses `TextSpan` for structured display)
  - **Hobbies** (Uses `TextSpan` to enhance readability)

## Technologies Used
- **Flutter** (Dart)
- **Material Design**
